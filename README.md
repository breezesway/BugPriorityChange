# BugPriorityChange
This repository stores the dataset and code for *Bug Priority Change: An Empirical Study on Apache Projects*.  
The following will explain the dataset and code we provide.
#### GoPriorityChanged
*GoPriorityChanged* is the relevant code for our calculation data, which is a program written in Golang. If you want to run it, please install Go 1.18.0 or higher version first.
#### ProjectCommit
This directory lists the commit record files for the 32 projects we studied.
> Please note that some projects (such as *Cordova*) correspond to multiple commit record files, as these projects have multiple code repositories, each corresponding to a commit record file.
#### RQresults  
In this directory, we provide the calculation results of all RQs in the paper. Each RQ calculation result corresponds to a CSV file, and you can easily know which CSV file corresponds to which RQ through the file name.
